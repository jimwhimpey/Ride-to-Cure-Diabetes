				<h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
				
				<p>	Type 1 Diabetes is a hereditary disease that affects 1 in 3000 young Australians
					and 1 in 2000 young people worldwide. The disease causes a failure of the pancreas 
					to generate and regulate a supply of insulin to the body. Insulin is used to 
					reduce the amount of glucose supplied to the body.</p>
					
				<p> Diabetes is treatable day to day by manually doing the job that a healthy pancreas 
					does automatically. People with Type 1 diabetes have to test their blood glucose
					levels multiple times a day and based on those values inject insulin into their 
					bodies.</p>
				
				<h2>Why Diabetes?</h2>
				
				<p>	When my sister Jill, was 10 years old she lost a huge amount of weight 
					and got very sick. She was admitted to the Mater Children's Hospital intensive 
					care unit where she was diagnosed with Juvenile Diabetes. From then her life changed 
					from a carefree childhood to managing a delicate balance of sugar in her blood. Too much 
					and she could go permanently blind, too little and she could slip into a coma.</p>
					
				<p>	The burden of diabetes is too much for a young child. There's several promising avenues 
					of research for a cure. For the research to continue they need money.</p>
				
				<h2>Diabetes Misconceptions</h2>
				
				<p>	Unfortunately juvenile or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1">
					type 1 diabetes</a>, a hereditary autoimmune disease that affects children 
					shares it's name with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2">
					type 2 diabetes</a>, a disorder brought on by unhealthy eating, unhealthy lifestyles 
					and obesity. Type 1 diabetes can only be treated with insulin injections and constant 
					blood glucose monitoring, type 2 diabetes is treated with exercise and diet change.</p>
					
				<p>	Type 2 diabetes is much more common, self inflicted through an unhealthy lifestyle and 
					is often referred to simply as diabetes. This confuses people and reduces sympathy for 
					sufferers of the more severe, hereditary type 1 diabetes that affects children.</p>
				
				<h2>The Charity, JDRF</h2>
				
				<p>	The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation has one goal, finding a cure 
					for Type 1 Diabetes. It's an international organisation with branches in 
					countries around the world including Australia. The Ride to Cure Diabetes in 
					Australia is one of many fund raising events that the JDRF runs every 
					year.</p>
					
				<p> Unlike other charities who squander money on "raising awareness", JDRF is focused 
					solely on finding a cure for Juvenile Diabetes, the only hope for children with the 
					disease.</p>
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="column" id="column2">
				
				<h2>What is the Ride to Cure Diabetes?</h2>
				
				<p>The Ride to Cure Diabetes is an annual fund raising event started by JDRF in the US 
					and adopted by JDRF Australia. Held in the South Australian Barossa Valley just one day 
					before the Tour Down Under. Participants need to raise a minimum of $3500 to take part in the 
					ride.</p>
					
				<p>The event is split into three distances to allow the most people possible to participate. I'll 
					be riding the 160km and longest course on the day.</p>
				
				<h2>Where does my donation go?</h2>
				
				<p>70 cents of every dollar raised goes directly to research. JDRF was recognised in May 2008 as the winner 
					of the Australian PricewaterhouseCoopers Transparency Award, designed to reward and encourage quality 
					financial and operational reporting in the not-for-profit sector. More information about how your donation 
					is used can be found at <a href="http://www.jdrf.org.au/about-jdrf-australia/where-your-money-goes">
					JDRF's website</a>.</p>
					
				<p>	JDRF is a registered Australian charity so your donation is 100% tax deductible. I have a receipt 
					book and I'm happy to provide a receipt to anyone who asks.</p>
				
				<h2>Who is Jim?</h2>
				
				<p>	I'm a 21 year old web developer who lives in Brisbane, Australia, loves cycling and hates diabetes.</p>
				
				<p>	In July 2009 I was <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/141205452">hit by a car while riding 
					my bike</a>. I broke 18 bones including almost every bone in 
					my face, 7 vertebrae and 5 ribs in my back. The Ride to Cure Diabetes is primarily about raising 
					funds for the JDRF but it has a secondary purpose for me personally, recovering from my accident.</p>
